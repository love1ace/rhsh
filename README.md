## Quick Start

Get **rhsh** up and running quickly!

1. **Run without arguments** (generates a 12-character random hash):
    ```bash
    npx rhsh
    ```

2. **Run with a custom length** (e.g., 16 characters):
    ```bash
    npx rhsh 16 
    ```

3. **Done!**

### Example Output

Without arguments:
```
Random hash (12 characters): a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

With custom length:
```
Random hash (16 characters): a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
```

## Usage

- Running `npx rhsh` without any arguments will generate a random 12-character hash.
- You can specify the desired length by adding a number after the command, e.g., `npx rhsh 10` for a 10-character random hash.
